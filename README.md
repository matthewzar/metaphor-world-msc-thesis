# Metaphor-World MSc Source
Metaphor World is the game I created for my MSc thesis: an interactive code-as-metaphor game. The goal was to test student's understandings of certain concepts by having them take on the role of code-interpreter.

## Technologies used
For any academic writing:
 - LaTeX
 - Lyx
 - BibTeX

Images were made using Paint.Net

Developer technologies:
 - Visual Studio
 - C#
 - XNA
 - WPF
 
The game jerry-rigs a WPF form into being half of an XNA game's front end.

# Not Maintained
This repo is not being maintained, or updated, I've made it available in case anyone wants to reference (or build on) [my thesis's](https://www.academia.edu/32532613/Developing_high-fidelity_mental_models_of_programming_concepts_using_manipulatives_and_interactive_metaphors) concept.

It was migrated from a private Git server, hence the missing commit history.

## To any future users/readers
This code was written before I had learned about code styles, or proper design in general... looking at it now, the implementation is embarrassingly naive. Sorry about that.

# Literature
Any literature included in this repo is there for any fellow Academics' convenience. I don't own any of it, and don't have distribution rights.
