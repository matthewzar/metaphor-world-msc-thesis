People understand things that they can see and touch.
In order for a learner to understand what the program is actually doing, the program flow must be made visible and tangible.

---------------------

For introducing loops rather start with whiles
This:
int i = 0;
while (i < 200
{
	line(i,0,200,i);
	i = i + 14


is easier to see flow of control in than this:
for(int i = 0; i < 200; i++)
	line(i,0,200,i);

----------------------

Make flow visible
For example the dots when consitions are met

----------------------

If you are serious about creating a programming environment for learning, the number one thing you can do -- more important than 
live coding or adjustable constants, more important than narrated lessons or discussion forums, more important than badges or 
points or ultra-points or anything else -- is to show the data.

----------------------

Could make an interactive 'map' of the program that the user needs to follow which could incorporate all the things mentioned
here as necesarry for udnerstanding/leanring programming. If a user gets stuck with a program, they can forfeit points or something
in order to take an 'automated' tour of the code (either in the 'map' or the 3D world or both)
