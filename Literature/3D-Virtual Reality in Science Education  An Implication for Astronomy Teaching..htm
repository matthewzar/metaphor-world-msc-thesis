    <br><br>  This work presents a new virtual environment (VE) which employs a
dynamic 3-D model of the solar system. It is based on powerful
scientific visualization&nbsp;techniques and can be used as an effective aide
in astronomy teaching. The learner "enters" a virtual model of
the physical world, journeys through it, zooms in or out as he or she
wishes, changes his or her view, point and perspective, as the virtual
world continues to "behave" and operate in its usual manner.
The continual motion of the planets generates day and night, seasons,
eclipses, and phases-topics that are customarily hard to grasp,
especially at young age. The model allows for a powerful learning
experience, and facilitates the mental construction of three-dimensional
space, where objects are varied and different, but share common features
and obey the same physical principles. The new platform helps to
overcome the inherent geocentric&nbsp;view and ensures the transition to a
scientific, heliocentric&nbsp;view of the solar system.

<br><br>  Teaching astronomy at the primary and secondary school levels is
usually a great challenge for science teachers. On the one hand, it is
an extremely appealing modem science that fascinates and attracts
children. On the other hand, it contains complex subjects in physics,
requires an understanding of three-dimensional dynamics, and demands
advanced cognitive capabilities. To understand the basic astronomical
phenomena--day and night, seasons, eclipses, phases of the moon and the
motion of planets--one must have the capability of visualizing events
and objects as they may appear from different perspectives
simultaneously. Children have initial conceptions of celestial objects
and phenomena, which are often reminiscent of ancient philosophical
ideas, notably Aristotelian geocentric views of the sun and planets.
Already (1966) noted many such conceptions in his early studies of child
development, and showed that children evoke their own cosmological
explanations even at very young ages. As they grow up, their ear ly
ideas are probably influenced by erroneous information presented in
everyday culture and mass media (Lanciano, 1999) such as science fiction
films and TV series. A simple example is the notion that spacecraft can
fly faster than the speed of light, as depicted in many scenes in the
films Star Wars and Star Trek. The private cosmological ideas become
deeply rooted beliefs, that are often inconsistent with the accepted
scientific view.

<br><br>  Indeed, many researches pointed out that children evoke their own
explanations for the easily observed astronomical phenomena, long before
they receive any formal education in either Earth sciences or astronomy
(Nussbaum &amp; Novak, 1976). Baxter (1989) found that children
construct alternative frameworks for explaining astronomical events that
become less naive as age progresses. He also found that many pupils
leaving school at the age of 16 years were unable to explain correctly
ordinary astronomical events. Some of these alternative frameworks
continue well into adult age, and are even found in university students
(Broughton, 1999). Comins (1993, 1995) identified common misconceptions
students have in astronomy and derived a set of origins that account for
them. This set includes, among others: factual misinformation,

<br><br>mythical concepts and language imprecision, misinterpreting sensory
information and incomplete understanding of the scientific process and
of scientists. Bennet&nbsp;(1999) goes further to state that without a
contextual framework within which to compare astronomical objects,
students have difficulty to mentally "file" the facts
associated with them. They also have difficulties in creating the
"big picture" from its various components.

<br><br>  SCIENTIFIC VISUALIZATION

<br><br>  Recent technological developments in the gathering and processing
of data, including the option of saving such data as photographic
images, have created a new domain in the visual presentation of
scientific information (Pea &amp; Gomez, 1992; Gordin &amp; Pea, 1996).
This new scientific field, made possible by the development of powerful
computers, links science, technology, computer science, and applied
visual arts&nbsp;in the designing of systems that can translate huge amounts
of quantitative data into digital graphic images. Variations in color
and shading can be used to represent numerical data&nbsp;that describe
different aspects of natural phenomena and processes. Such
representations can portray complex phenomena in their entirety and can
also consist of a series of images depicting changes over time.

<br><br>  Examples for the visual representation of scientific information
can be found today in all fields of science&nbsp;and technology. In medicine,
magnetic resonance imaging&nbsp;yields precise three-dimensional images of
the human body. Earth scientists produce films that illustrate how
hurricanes and tornadoes develop and how the earth's ozone layer&nbsp;is
changing. Physicists build three-dimensional computerized models to
describe the internal structure of the atom. These examples form an
array of visual representations that seem to dominate the presentation
of scientific knowledge. Combined with multimedia-based databases, these
representations may help students and teachers understand complex
abstract phenomena, and it is only natural to expect that they be
integrated into the science curriculum. With the help of
three-dimensional graphics software, educators are building a new visual
language that bridges the gap between the concrete world of nature and
the abstract world of concepts and models. The CoVis project, for ex
ample, is developing educational activities in which students analyze
and interpret complex visual representations in atmospheric science
(Pea, 1993). "Visual Earth" (McWilliams, 1998) is a product of
TERC&nbsp;that allows teachers and students to explore geographical subjects
using satellite and GIS data sets.

<br><br>  The use of computer-generated images and of other visual sources of
information in present-day scientific research is generally referred to
as scientific visualization. Scientific visualization provides a way of
observing natural phenomena that, perhaps due to their size, duration,
or location, are difficult or impossible to observe directly (Furness,
Winn, &amp; Yu, 1997). In the realm of astronomy, data sent back by the
Hubbell Space Telescope (HST) and by other space probes are transformed
into images that are enhanced, edited, and analyzed to reveal important
new details about our neighbors in space. Astronomers often create video
animations to model theories about the creation of the universe. These
scientific visualization tools and techniques are helping scientists to
gain a better understanding of how our solar system formed and how it
continues to evolve and change over time.

<br><br>  VIRTUAL REALITY AND SCIENCE EDUCATION

<br><br>  Faced with the inherent difficulties of the subject matter, the
need for new technological solutions in science education is clear.
Virtual reality (VR) and virtual environments (VE) are becoming
increasingly prevalent in the educational arena, and many studies
concentrate on the impact of VE on learning and knowledge construction.
While formerly restricted to military, medical, and industrial
applications, the rapid increase in computational capabilities of
desktop PCs allows the use of VR attributes for educational purposes. A
thorough review of human factor issues in the design and implementation
of VR was given by Stanney, Mourant, &amp; Kennedy (1998). A framework
for considering the characteristics of VR that can be useful for
research was suggested by Zeltzer (1992). It is based on three
dimensions: autonomy, presence, and interaction. A specific VR/VE can be
regarded autonomous if it functions fully without the need for user
inputs. Presence reflects the feeling that the user experiences as if he
is indee d in the actual world represented by the VE, forgetting
completely that he is actually in a laboratory (classroom) with a glove
and helmet on. The presence dimension depends on user-interface issues
such as the filed-of-view, the rendering rate at which images are being
generated by the computer and the polygon&nbsp;count, which inspires the
authenticity of the objects shown. Interaction, according to&nbsp;Zeltzer
(1992) reflects the consistency of the environment's responses to
user inputs. A VR/VE product should behave according to the natural laws
that govern the real world they strive to portray. It should be
emphasized that for educational purposes, a VE must be designed in such
a manner that would not distort the physical laws of nature, otherwise
the danger of amplifying misconceptions or generating new ones in the
user's mind is greatly increased.

<br><br>  In a report to the National Science Foundation (NSF), Furness et
al. (1997) discussed the various attributes of VR with respect to
learning, and put a special focus on the potential benefits of using VR
in teaching the multifaceted&nbsp;issue of Global Change. They state as a
general principle that "VR improves learning, when it does, by
providing the learners with new, direct experiences of phenomena they
could not have experienced before, either in direct interaction with the
real world or using other technologies." Among the other principles
that apply to VR in the context of education, Furness et al. (1997)
suggested that VR is engaging and seductive, and can teach complex
topics with less need to simplify them. In a VR/VE, learners can easily
and without effort visit places and view objects from different points
of view, and can experiment by manipulating variables that cannot be
manipulated in the real world. This emphasizes the notion that VR is
ideal for letting students explore things and construct their own
knowledge. Winn (1997) further discussed the use of VR for studying
Global Change and concluded that the variety of modalities&nbsp;and symbolic
forms VR/VEs offer is likely to reach more students than just teacher
presentation or text. Global Change is indeed a complex topic that
involves many different disciplines (meteorology, oceanography, solar
physics, atmospheric chemistry, and radiative transfer, to name but a
few) and is replete with student's preconceptions.

<br><br>  Much like Global Change, astronomy is a complex subject matter that
is rooted in the science curriculum. It deals with basic aspects of the
natural world, which the learner is directly exposed to from early on in
his life. In modem society astronomy is an integral part of the daily
information flux children are exposed to. Space shuttle&nbsp;flight, images
from the HST and reports from planetary missions appear regularly on
television and in the newspapers. The Internet is literally flooded with
information on astronomical events and many computer games are situated
in outer space and involve some form of planetary or cosmic objects. It
is clear that astronomy enjoys a great appeal, which may sometime hinder
the proper, deep and methodical understanding of its underlying
principles. We can safely assume that if properly designed and used,
astronomy teaching can benefit immensely from the powerful attributes of
VR.

<br><br>  THE VIRTUAL SOLAR SYSTEM

<br><br>  A novel and powerful learning environment for studying astronomy
was developed through a joint effort of the Center for Education
Technology (CET) and Tel-Aviv University's Science and Technology
Education Center (SATEC) in Tel-Aviv, Israel. The major component in the
Touch the Sky-Touch the Universe CD-ROM&nbsp;is a 3D model with virtual
reality (VR) features, which is based on state-of-the-art scientific
visualization techniques. VR in this sense is a medium where a user can
operate within a realistic representation of 3-dimensional space, in
real time. It is a nonimmersive platform, which is different from the
traditional VR in that it does not entail the use of gloves or masks. If
the Salzman, Dede, McGlynn, and Loftin (1996) categorization of VR/VE is
referred to, then Touch the Sky is very high in autonomy and
interaction, and less so in the aspect of presence. As will be discussed
later, this can be used to enhance the effectiveness of the learning
process.

<br><br>  The enhanced computational power of the Intel Pentium III&nbsp;processor
(266 MHz&nbsp;and higher) and its 3D graphical capabilities enabled us to
design a dynamic solar system. The high rendering rate is manifested in
an extremely realistic portrayal of the planets and of the other objects
in the system, while their relative positions and movements are
constantly calculated and updated in real-time.

<br><br>  MAIN FEATURES

<br><br>  The model includes the sun, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets,
revolving and rotating in their orbits against the constant background
of the Milky Way, the stars and constellations (Figure 1). Although the
relative sizes and distances of the objects were shrunk and scaled, the
Keplerian motion was kept unchanged and at the true relative rates.
High-resolution NASA&nbsp;images were used to construct the objects, and
their numerical data was calibrated&nbsp;with great accuracy. The user enters
a (virtual) model of the physical world, where the computer mouse
becomes a spaceship that permits a journey through space, to zoom in or
out as one wishes, easily changing the view point and perspective. The
virtual solar system continues to "behave" and operate in its
usual manner and the planets rotate and revolve continuously, as the
program continuously computes the location of the observer with respect
to them.

<br><br>  The user can navigate in space, "fly" above and below the
ecliptic&nbsp;plane, approach any object and view it from many angles. The
numerical data and orbital parameters, as well as other information, are
displayed when a specific object is touched. The continual motion of the
planets around the only light source in the system (the sun) naturally
generates day and night, seasons, eclipses and phases, which can be
easily explored and studied.

<br><br>  The User Interface

<br><br>  The success of a VR highly depends on the friendliness of the user
interface. Upon entering the dynamic 3-D virtual representation of the
solar system, the user has to project himself into this
"reality" and to adopt to new looking points, which is by no
means an easy cognitive task, especially at young ages. Darken&nbsp;and
Sibert (1996) showed that a representation of spatial coordinates is
essential for orientation in large-scale virtual environments. The lose
of orientation and "vertigo" feeling which often accompanies
learning in a virtual-environment is minimized by the display of a
traditional, two-dimensional dynamic map of the solar system (Figure 2).
A dynamic camera icon that is projected on the map represents the
user's location and observation point with respect to the viewed
object and to the entire solar system. This map helps to navigate and
orient the user, and facilitates an easier learning experience. It also
helps to overcome the sense of bewilderment which is sometimes induced
by the fact that there are objects (such as the planet Uranus) that
rotate in an unfamiliar manner. The user has an additional navigation
"remote control," with arrows to steer and change the
orientation in 3-dimensional space.

<br><br>  A set of structured inquiries has been added to the learning
environment, which aim to orient and teach the student various aspects
of astronomy. These activities navigate the user to specific
observations, and ask guided questions which deal with basic
observations. For example, the user is positioned above the Moon's
orbital plane&nbsp;with both Earth and the Sun in view, and is asked to note
the changing angle between the illuminated part of the moon and the
Earth, and to relate the observations to the phases of the Moon. Another
example is the identification of the sun as the only source of light in
the solar system, by noting the dark and illuminated sides (night and
day) of all the planets. The interpretation of visual information is
aided by these structured activities.

<br><br>  Modes of Observation and their cognitive implications

<br><br>  There are 4 modes of observations from which the user can choose:

<br><br>  1. The Free-Mode: this is the default option, and a free flight in
space is enabled. In this mode the student is free to explore the solar
system without focusing on a preselected object. The planets and their
moons keep moving in the orbits at the specified rates. In terms of VR,
this mode is the most accurate, unmediated&nbsp;view of the system. It forces
the user to reflect on the validity of concepts such as "up"
and "down" in space and to deduce the importance of the
frame-of-reference when describing location and movement.

<br><br>  2. Sun-in-Site view: the chosen object is shown together with the
sun, from a vantage point. This position illustrates the respective
distance and order of the planet from the sun, and fosters the creation
of a "system" view, rather than a separate "object"
view, where objects are seen without the spatial relations to the entire
solar system (Figure 3).

<br><br>  3. Planetary view: the planet (or moon, asteroid, comet) is shown
in the center of the screen, and the user is "locked" onto it
as if travelling in tandem&nbsp;in its orbit. There is always the ability to
zoom in and out and to position oneself wherever one chooses, but the
planet always remains at the center, rotating at its nominal rate. This
view is useful for a detailed study of atmospheric and surface features,
and for astronomical phenomena such as day-and-night, seasons, and
phases (Figure 4). For example, viewing the polar ice caps&nbsp;and their
relative illumination can be linked to the seasonal cycle (in Northern
Hemisphere mid-winter, the entire polar cap&nbsp;remains dark).

<br><br>  4. Geocentric view: this option positions the observer as a geo-
(planeto-) centric satellite, rotating at the same rate as the object
that is observed. The effect is that the object seems to be
"frozen" at the center, and the entire "world"
rotates around the observer. This view actually shows the sun rotating
around the earth. Although disconcerting&nbsp;at first, this view is
extremely useful in overcoming the basic difficulty of compromising the
inherent geocentric view, which children possess (Lanciano, 1999) with
the correct Copernican model.

<br><br>  Teachers can instruct students to hop between different views and
deduce their own conclusions on their place in the system. A
confrontation between how things look from a fixed position above the
Earth and the view from space (where the Earth revolves around the sun)
should help in overcoming the inherent geocentric model.

<br><br>  In addition to changes in the viewing point, the user also has an
option to change the speed of the entire system, by accelerating or
slowing the rotation and revolution rates. This is a strong exploratory
tool which enables to investigate how basic phenomena would change as a
result of this modification. "What if" questions are useful
for elucidating complex astronomical phenomena (Comins, 1999). The
present model allows a direct study of questions like "what would
happen if the Earth rotated faster," where the consequences are
apparent immediately on the computer screen.

<br><br>  Pedagogical&nbsp;Benefits

<br><br>  The Touch the Sky, Touch the Universe program lets students
interact directly with various forms of multimedia that simulate
resources used by practicing scientists. Journeys through the virtual
simulations of the solar system and the Milky Way help students bridge
the gap between the concrete world of nature and the abstract realm of
concepts and models. As students examine images, manipulate
three-dimensional models, and participate in these virtual simulations,
they enhance their understanding of scientific concepts and processes.
Students are not simply passive recipients of prepackaged&nbsp;multimedia
content, and can use a variety of computerized tools to view, navigate,
and analyze a realistic three-dimensional representation of space. This
makes the construction of a holistic picture of the solar system, where
all its components are shown simultaneously (Bennet, 1999), a much
easier task. The included research activities challenge students to
keenly observe and interpret the events as they unfold before th eir
eyes during their VR "flight" in space. Students' search
for understanding would prompt repeated experimentation with the 3-D
simulations and consultation of other information sources in the
program. Students can be guided to put their observations into the
context of their own experience to help them understand the information
presented in the program.

<br><br>  Such learning activities provide students with a more intuitive
understanding&nbsp;of astronomy and contribute to the development of
essential visual literacy&nbsp;and information-processing skills. Many
contemporary students are quite adept at processing and understanding
visual information as a result of their experience with television,
films, and computers. As they become more confident in their ability to
constructively interact with the VR elements in the program, students
should increasingly use these new technologies as a medium for sharing
information and discussing ideas and conclusions.

<br><br>  SUMMARY

<br><br>  The 3D-virtual reality model of the solar system holds substantial
didactical advantages that can be used as an effective aide in astronomy
teaching:

<br><br>  * It allows for a powerful learning experience. Space and astronomy
have always captured the human imagination, and children are naturally
drawn to space science. The new model enables students to explore space
as if flying in their own spaceship. They decides by themselves where to
go, what to watch and from what distance and angle.

<br><br>  * It facilitates the mental construction of three-dimensional
space, where objects are in constant motion. The new view is remarkably
different from the traditional two-dimensional representation of
celestial objects. Complex planetary motions are made simple when
observing, for example, the Earth rotating as it revolves around the
sun.

<br><br>  * It enables the learner to discover the relation between distance,
motion and time. The user can explore the physical laws governing the
universe by observing planetary motions, and to deduce their uniformity
("Day and night occur on other planets, too").

<br><br>  * It offers a tool that helps to overcome the inherent geocentric
view of the world, thus ensuring the transition to a scientific,
heliocentric view of the solar system.
