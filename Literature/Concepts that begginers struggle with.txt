The For Loop (according to worrydream) <because of its unclear flow>

Simple assignment (and treating statemnts more like maths equations, first hand experience also found in Bayman 1983
(only 43% of students could explain what 'LET D = 0' did)

Reference Assignment Vs Value Asignment (Linxiao, Ferguson, Roper, Wood)

Recursion, model is often held more like a loop than a more viable copy model ( kahey et al. and Gotschi et al)

Constructors, objects and nulls; as in "4 participants believed that an object would be created
automatically when a reference variable was declared." (according to Ma et al. pg 501 5.1.3)

Writeline/Print(X) according to BAYMAN only 33 percent of student learning BASIC correctly described what this statement would do
some of the incorrect answers that were given include "Print the letter X on the screen", "Write the letter X in memory" and "Print either "error"
 or nothing on the screen (although in this case X doesnt exist so yet so its an understandible mistake"
However 'Print "X"' was interpretted correctly 80% of the time (this leads me to think that variables are sometimes seen as literals

3% of users in the Bayman study understood what 'Input A' meant, this would translate to System.ReadLine(A) in C# (this is scary)
This could be given to the user in my game as something like speech from the user, a message in the sky or anything else that
couldn't have been created by the computer
